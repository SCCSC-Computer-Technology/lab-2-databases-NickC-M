Hello Nick, Just reviewed your code. The GUI is very friendly with minimal reading which I appreciate. The code also runs really well. I know it was a rather simple lab but I would love to see more comments just for documentation purposes. I would also love to see the values of total / avg etc... show up inside of the data view instead of a message window but, it does work and it is very clean

The only major critic I have is that when adding stuff to the data view the ID comes up as -1 which is an invalid number for a primary key. This is caused because the properties of the primary key are set to start at -1 and increment by -1. Other than that. I love the look of it and the code runs very smooth. Great job!

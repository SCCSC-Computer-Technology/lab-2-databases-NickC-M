Lab 2 Code Review
By Shawn Conboy

First Impressions

	Solid. A+. The UI looked clean and simplistic. All buttons worked,
	I was able to add a record and save it with no issues.

Is the code generally readable and well documented?

	Yes. Code is readable. Well documented, not so much. I understand this is a
	simple project and the methods are more or less self explanatory.  Add comments
	throughout to help documentation. Picture if a non tech person was trying to 
	read this. The goal is to simplify and document to that level.

Did you find any software defects?
	
	No. This project worked 100% for me. I'm relieved to have made this my 4th
	review because of how well put together it is.


What was one way that your solution differed from yours?

	When you press the button for a max or a min population. We can see the population
	But not the city or state that population belongs to. I had to go back into
	my code to create a way to clarify that. I think that's better for UI to know 
	exactly what a user is looking at.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

	Not really. Like I said earlier, I really liked this project. It was simple and clean.
	Fully functional. 

	If anything, I'd suggest formatting your numbers in your message boxes so that
	they have commas to separate some of the long numbers. Use "N0" in your toString()
	and that will format it.
